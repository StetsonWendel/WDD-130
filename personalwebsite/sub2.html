            The word Qur'an means "recitation." The Qur'an is a recitation or 
            pronouncement of Allah's word. About the size of the New Testament,
            it is very unlike the New Testament. It is not a book of history and 
            does not tell a story, though there are several narratives in it.
            Instead it is a collection of individual pronouncements in the 
            words of Allah. Having 114 chapters each is an individual revelation.
            Muhammad does not speak in the Qur'an nor does a narrator the only
            speaker is Allah. The Qur'an for Muslims is God's Word, character,
            attributes, and person revealed in words in a book. This is why 
            many Muslims argue that the Qur'an cannot be translated because
            no matter how faithfully the translation once changed into different
            words it is no longer Gods words. This leads some renderings in other
            languages will adopt carefully worded titles that are meant to remind
            the reader that what they have is not the Qur'an but an translation of it.
