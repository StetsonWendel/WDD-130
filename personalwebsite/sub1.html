        <h1>History of Islam</h1>
        <div class="paragraphText">
            The History of Islam starts with the life of Muhammad. Muhammad was born
            in the Arabian city of Mecca around 570 CE with his prophetic call coming
            in about 610 CE. Arabian society was polytheistic, and Mecca was a 
            religious center. In the city their was (and still is) a large cubical
            structure called the Kaaba witched housed the images of the city's Gods.
            Muslims believe that te Kaaba was built by Abraham and his son Ishmael or
            repaired by them and built earlier by Adam.

        <div class="paragraphText" >
            In Muhammad's time annual pilgrimages to the Kaaba to worship Mecca's gods
            brought visitors and their money to the city. After Muhammad received and 
            then embraced his calling from God, Muhammad started to gather converts
            who believed his message. Over the course of time a sizable body of Muslims
            was found in Mecca. This new religion was a problem for the leaders of Mecca
            as Muhammad's revelations were the words of one god, Allah, and they condemned
            the existence of any other god. This was an economic threat that if spread
            would reduce the income from pilgrimages to worship the various deities. 
            This caused leaders to persecute the growing Muslim community making it
            necessary for them to leave.

        <div class="paragraphText">
            Upon invitation Muhammad and the Muslims emigrated to the city of Yathrib.
            The city would latter be known as Medina. This marked a turning point in 
            Islam as it created the first Islamic state where Muhammad was not just 
            the the religious leader but also the political leader of Medina and a 
            place where Muslims could worship safely.

            Continued hostility and opposition from the residents of Mecca led to 
            combat and after eight years of conflict Muhammad and his followers 
            took control of Mecca. They cleansed the Kaaba and rededicating it to
            the worship of Allah. Making Mecca the most holy city in the religion
            of Islam.
