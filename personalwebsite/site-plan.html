        What is Islam? 
        Islam is a religion that began in Arabia in the seventh century and 
        since then has spread to all around the world. Followers of the Islamic
        faith are called Muslims. The word Islam means "submission to God" and
        a Muslim is "One who submits to God." Muslims worship the the same God
        as Jews and Christians using the Arabic name Allah. 
        
        Muslims believe Islam to be the true religion that has existed since
        the beginning of time. They believe that a cycle of revelation,
        apostasy, and restoration occurred throughout history that ended with 
        Muhammad and Gods revelation to him the Qur'an.

      <h3>History of Islam</h3>
      <p>
        The History of Islam starts with the life of Muhammad. Muhammad was born
        in the Arabian city of Mecca around 570 CE with his prophetic call coming
        in about 610 CE. Arabian society was polytheistic, and Mecca was a 
        religious center. In the city their was (and still is) a large cubical
        structure called the Kaaba witched housed the images of the city's Gods.
        Muslims believe that te Kaaba was built by Abraham and his son Ishmael or
        repaired by them and built earlier by Adam. 
        
        In Muhammad's time annual pilgrimages to the Kaaba to worship Mecca's gods
        brought visitors and their money to the city. After Muhammad received and 
        then embraced his calling from God, Muhammad started to gather converts
        who believed his message. Over the course of time a sizable body of Muslims
        was found in Mecca. This new religion was a problem for the leaders of Mecca
        as Muhammad's revelations were the words of one god, Allah, and they condemned
        the existence of any other god. This was an economic threat that if spread
        would reduce the income from pilgrimages to worship the various deities. 
        This caused leaders to persecute the growing Muslim community making it
        necessary for them to leave. 

        Upon invitation Muhammad and the Muslims emigrated to the city of Yathrib.
        The city would latter be known as Medina. This marked a turning point in 
        Islam as it created the first Islamic state where Muhammad was not just 
        the the religious leader but also the political leader of Medina and a 
        place where Muslims could worship safely.  

        Continued hostility and opposition from the residents of Mecca led to 
        combat and after eight years of conflict Muhammad and his followers 
        took control of Mecca. They cleansed the Kaaba and rededicating it to
        the worship of Allah. Making Mecca the most holy city in the religion
        of Islam.

      <h3>The Qur'an</h3>
      <p>
        The word Qur'an means "recitation." The Qur'an is a recitation or 
        pronouncement of Allah's word. About the size of the New Testament,
        it is very unlike the New Testament. It is not a book of history and 
        does not tell a story, though there are several narratives in it.
        Instead it is a collection of individual pronouncements in the 
        words of Allah. Having 114 chapters each is an individual revelation.
        Muhammad does not speak in the Qur'an nor does a narrator the only
        speaker is Allah. The Qur'an for Muslims is God's Word, character,
        attributes, and person revealed in words in a book. This is why 
        many Muslims argue that the Qur'an cannot be translated because
        no matter how faithfully the translation once changed into different
        words it is no longer Gods words. This leads some renderings in other
        languages will adopt carefully worded titles that are meant to remind
        the reader that what they have is not the Qur'an but an translation of it.
